# meta-cattertainment
This layer manages all specific needs for the Cattertainment system.
Main configurations added by this layer:
- Network configuration: 
    * Launching AP mode.
    * Crating customizable WLAN SSID and password.
    * DHCP server. 
- Podman container deployment orchestration:
    * Preloading container image.
    * Podman Compose for enabling multiplie containerized applications. 

**TODO:** Add AP + STA simultaneously to add web server capabilities for video streaming. 

Mantainers: Me, sadly.
